These are empty aerosol cans. The official recycling guide of Baltimore states: "If the aerosol can is completely empty, it should be recycled in your curbside pickup. If it is not empty, it should be taken to one of the Household Hazardous Waste collection events." Therefore, these items can be recycled.
